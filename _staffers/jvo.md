Hi! I'm Justin Vo, a second year computer science major. I've been an Undergraduate Learning Assistant since January 2021
for CS156. I'm interested in how we can use software to impact people's lives postively. Currently, I'm interested
in full stack web development, machine learning, and a little bit of game development. Outside of computer science,
I like to play games, drive, and build LEGO sets. As a ULA, I hope to make computer science fun and accessible for all!
