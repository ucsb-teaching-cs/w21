# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 16

## Contributed by Bryan Xu

### Programming question
Why am I getting some weird output in my code? When I try to print out my array, sometimes there's weird characters at the end. For example, when I put in the input "ada%)(+dqwporiqrAIOPIDABaM<<NAB*&%+=12)", I get a bunch of junk values printed in my output! (buggy.cpp)

### Conceptual questions
When making a char[], can I directly treat it as a string, or are there differences between the two?
