For this assignment, we ask that you read the following paper:

* Diba Mirza, Phillip T. Conrad, Christian Lloyd, Ziad Matni, and Arthur Gatin. 2019. Undergraduate Teaching Assistants in Computer Science: A Systematic Literature Review. In Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER '19). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 31–40.

Here's a link: [PDF](https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/f20/hwk/h01/mirza-ula-lit-review.pdf)

There are some sections of the paper that you should read carefully,
while others you can just skim.  Here's a guide:

* Section 1: *Read carefully*. Understand the purpose
  of the paper, and the three main research questions addressed.
* Sections 2 and 3: *Ok to Skim*. These sections address the methodology
  of the paper, i.e how one goes about doing a structure literature
  review.  This is important from a research standpoint, and to assess
  the validity of the results, but for purposes of this class, we are
  more interested in the results themselves.
* Section 4: *Read Carefully*.  This is the heart of the paper, and the
  section that we'll be focusing on.
* Section 5: *Ok to Skim*. Another section about methodology.  A
  "threats to validity" section is an important part of any paper,
  you are encouraged to read it, but it isn't necessary for the assignment.
* Sections 6: *Read Carefully*.  This points towards future work, and
  is part of the assignment.

Then, there are questions to answer on Gradescope in the assignment
marked H01.
