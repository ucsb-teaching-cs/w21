## Assignment 

ULAs often conduct review sessions where they go over various course topics, explain how to approach solving certain types of problems, and demonstrate how to approach/deconstruct a specific concept. At the end of this assignment, you will have seen the differenct types of concepts / questions your fellow 190J peers have seen this quarter, and the strategies they use to address them.

For this assignment, we ask that you prepare a 5-10 minute teaching demo explaining a topic/concept or a walk-through of an example from the course your are a ULA for, and then test how well your audience/"students" are able to apply what you've explained by asking some follow-up questions. This demo will be recorded, so that after this exercise, you can watch it and reflect on your experience, what you did well, and what you or would have liked to do differently during the demo / would like to do differently in the future.

The goals of this assignment are to:
* Practice identifying learning goals/objectives 
* Use the _backward design_ to determine what information students will need to reach this goal
* Design an assessment to check students' ability

Additionally, as part of this assignment, you will 
* Organize and consolidate information
* Design slides / materials / notes / assessment
* Present your demo to the 190J students
* Reflect on your experience

### Select your topic/concept and determine the learning goal(s)

The easiest way for you to select a topic is to think of the commonly asked questions or misconceptions that you've seen in your course.

Once you have identified the topic for your demo, think about what should the students need to be able to do to demonstrate their learning. Use the [Action Verbs](https://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/preparing-to-teach/tips-on-writing-course-goalslearning-outcomes-and-measureable-learning-objectives/) to write down your learning goals for the demo. (Side note: Learning goals are interchangeably called learning outcomes or learning objectives. Read more about the [Learning Outcomes and Backward Design](https://oia.arizona.edu/content/290)).
